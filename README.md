# MERN-Starter
A Basic MERN Starter App Created as a boilerplate for future projects


## Important to Remember.

npm has to be initialised 3 seperate times for the setup of this project
1. Once in the main directory which will set up concurrency for running both front and back-end samultaneously.
2. Once for the backend to install express + mongoose + other dependencies
3. And finally once for the client side.

> To start make sure that both the front and backend ports are synced. and finally to begin just type 'npm start' and hopefully everything should work.
